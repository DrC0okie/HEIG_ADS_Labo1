## Task 1: What do these commands do?
> Execute the following commands in the given order. In a sentence or two, precisely
> describe what each does (English or French).
> To get documentation look up the commands using the man command. When using man , be
> careful that you are seeing the correct section (1), as the same term may be a
> command, a system call or something else. Some of the commands are shell built-ins
> ( cd , pwd , ...) which don't have manual entries, for these you can use the shell's
> help command. If the built-in help of the operating system is too confusing, try
> Google.
