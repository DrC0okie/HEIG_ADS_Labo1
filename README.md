## Task 1: What do these commands do?
> Execute the following commands in the given order. In a sentence or two, precisely
> describe what each does (English or French).
> To get documentation look up the commands using the man command. When using man , be
> careful that you are seeing the correct section (1), as the same term may be a
> command, a system call or something else. Some of the commands are shell built-ins
> ( cd , pwd , ...) which don't have manual entries, for these you can use the shell's
> help command. If the built-in help of the operating system is too confusing, try
> Google.



1. `nano newfile` Opens a file (in this case "newfile") in the nano editor. If the file does not exist, creates a new one.
2. `ls`  List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default).  Sort entries alphabetically.
  `ls -l` Use a long listing format displaying more detailed information such as the modification date and the rights
3. `cat newfile`  Displays the contents of one file without having to open the file for editing.
4. `cat /etc/hosts /etc/hostname`  Displays the content of both `/etc/hosts` and `/etc/hostname` files.
5. `ls -sh ~/.bashrc` Lists directory contents with the allocated size of each file, in blocks, in human readable format (e.g., 1K 234M 2G)
6. `pwd`
  `cd ..`
  `pwd`
7. `pwd`
  `cd .`
  `pwd`
8. `cd /home`
  `ls -l`
  `ls albert.einstein` (replace albert.einstein with your user id)
  `ls -a albert.einstein`
  `ls -d albert.einstein`
9. cd /tmp
  mkdir -p albert.einstein/bar/baz
  cd albert.einstein
  rmdir bar
  rmdir bar/baz
  rmdir bar
  Hint: rmdir 's behavior is not immediately obvious. Be careful.

    less /usr/share/doc/bash/INTRO.gz

    Hint: Break down each part of the command first.
